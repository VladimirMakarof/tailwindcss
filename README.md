## My First Project with Tailwind CSS
This repository contains my first educational project using the popular front-end framework Tailwind CSS.

# Overview
The project is a simple website designed to showcase the features of Tailwind CSS. It includes multiple pages, such as a home page, an about page, and a contact page, all of which are built using the Tailwind CSS framework.

# Installation
To run this project locally, you will need to have Node.js installed on your computer. Once you have Node.js installed, you can clone this repository and install the necessary dependencies using the following commands:

```
git clone https://github.com/VladimirMakarof/tailwindcss.git

```

# Usage
